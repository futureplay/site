    <p class="p1">Futureplay Oy (‘<strong>Futureplay</strong>, ‘<strong>we</strong>’, ‘<strong>us</strong>’) cares about your privacy. This Privacy Policy provides information on how we collect, process and protect your personal data in all our operations, as well as your rights regarding such data. </p>
    <p class="p1">We only collect and process personal data to such an extent that is necessary for our business operations and for providing and developing our mobile game applications and websites (our ‘<strong>Services</strong>’).</p>
    <p class="p1">We use your data to provide our Services, to communicate with you, to provide customer support and for game development purposes. This helps us to understand our customers better and to create better experiences for you in the future. We also send some of your data to third parties when you choose to watch an advert in our games. These third parties may use it for marketing purposes, including targeted advertising. Working with advertising networks in this manner allows us to continue to offer our games to you free of charge.     </p>
    <p class="p1">Typically, we collect your data when you first use our Services (i.e. when you install a mobile game application); when you play the game (e.g. in-game event analytics and personalised gameplay experiences); and when you interact directly with us (e.g. customer service correspondence). 
    </p>
    <p class="p1">From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the way we handle data. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. 
    </p>
    <p class="p1">Our personal data processing operations are based on the relevant national and international regulations, adhering to the rules and principles of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, we recommend you refrain from using our Services.

        <ul class="ul1">
                <li class="li2">your IDFV (device identifier for vendors). This is an internal identification used to save game progress, and it allows us to run the game effectively. This identifier is not shared with third parties, and can not be attributed to you outside of Futureplay.</li>
                <li class="li2">your IDFA (device identifier for advertisers). This can be matched to you, and is used for marketing. It is shared with third parties who may use it for personalised marketing. Allowing third parties to advertise in our games allows us to offer our Services to you for free.</li>
            </ul>
    <p class="p1">You can reset your IDFA in your mobile device’s Settings or by following the instructions in <a href="#IDFA"><strong>Marketing -> Third Parties -> Resetting your IDFA.</strong></a> Resetting your IDFA erases all data previously associated with it, meaning you will no longer receive personalised adverts.

    <p class="p1">We collect the above information based upon your agreement with our <a href="http://www.futureplaygames.com/termsofservice.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>, and it ensures we can effectively provide our Services to you.

    <h3 id="game-dev"><h3>Game development and optimisation</h3>
    <p class="p1">Our passion is to create awesome mobile games that you can enjoy for many years to come. In order to continue improving the games we make, we collect analytics regarding the actions you take in the game. 
        </p>
    <p class="p1">We collect your device ID, device information and geolocation. This is used for in-game matchmaking, optimising the game to your device specifications and understanding how our players interact with the game so we can continuously improve it and adjust the game to your playing style. It also helps us troubleshoot any potential problems and deal with your queries efficiently, as discussed below in <a href="#cust_comm"><strong>Customer Communications.</strong></a>   
        </p>
    <p class="p1">If you wish, you can also choose to connect to Facebook when you use our games. By connecting to Facebook in the game you will be agreeing to their Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. When you connect to Facebook, we receive information such as your public profile, friends list and profile picture. We use this information to display your profile in the game and facilitate features such as gift sending and receiving. You can disconnect your Facebook account at any time <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications" target="_blank">here.</a></p>


    <h3 id="fraud"><h3>Fraud Prevention</h3>
    <p class="p1">It’s important to us to provide a safe, reliable and trustworthy service. We use a third-party fraud prevention tool called AppsFlyer (a mobile marketing platform), which attributes mobile game application installs to unique devices to prevent fraudulent use of our Services. To provide its service effectively, AppsFlyer processes your IDFA, device specs and geolocation information when you first use our Services.

    <h3 id="marketing"><h3>Marketing</h3>
    <h4 id="third"><h4>Third Parties</h4>
    <p class="p1">Our Services use built-in advertising run by third-party advertising networks that you can choose to initiate to enhance the in-game experience. Such advertisements allow us to offer you our Services for free. 
        </p>
    <p class="p1">When you view an advert in the game, the advertising network receives and processes your unique Identification for Advertising (IDFA). Advertising networks use this to send you advertising. You can reset and/or disable your IDFA at any time by following the instructions below in <a href="#IDFA"><strong>Resetting your IDFA</strong></a>.
    <p class="p1">Advertising networks handle your IDFA in accordance with their respective privacy policies, which you can consult on their website.
